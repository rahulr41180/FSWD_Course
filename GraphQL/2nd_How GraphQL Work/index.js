
// How GraphQL Work :

/* 
1. In the RestFul APIs we have to create multiple end points to fetch specific data this will cause us overfetching and
underfetching.

2. In the GraphQL we have to create only one end point to fetch the data and later we can filter out the data from
fetched data.
*/

// Query :

/*
If we want to get data from server in that case we will always do query
To get data
*/

// Mutation :

/*
If we want to post, update and delete data from server in that case we will always do Mutation.

to Post / Update / Delete data
*/

// Resolver :

/*
To handle that Query request or Mutation request we need Resolver that means
Resolver will handle the Query and Mutation request.
We need Resolver to calculate or handle the logic of GraphQL request

It's like controller which is responsible to calculate or handle the logic of RestFul APIs request.
*/

/*
Query is a Operation.
Mutation is also a Operation.
Resolver is a resolver to resolve the logic of Query and Mutation.
