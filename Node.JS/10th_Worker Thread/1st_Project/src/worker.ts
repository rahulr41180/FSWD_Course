This listens for messages sent from the main thread via worker.postMessage(...).
The worker listens for messages from the main thread and sends a response back.

After receiving a message from the main thread, this sends a message back to the main thread.
Thatâ€™s where the worker.on('message') in server.ts picks it up.
