/*
Note: Workers canâ€™t directly run .ts	They need compiled .js files.

Do you need to build worker.ts every time?
Yes, if you're editing worker.ts, you need to build it so the updated worker.js is available for worker_threads to run.

That's because:

worker_threads only executes compiled JavaScript files (.js)

So it can't directly run .ts files unless you use hacks like ts-node, which are not optimal for performance
