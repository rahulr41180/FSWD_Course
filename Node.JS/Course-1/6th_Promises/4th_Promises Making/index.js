
// Promise Making :

/* 
Promise is an Object representation.

If we want a Object instance so to achieve that we have to use "new" keyword.
It will help us to create instance of Object representation.

If we want to create new Promise then we have to first create instance of Object representation.
We can do this by using "new" key word.
"new" keyword is also an object.
