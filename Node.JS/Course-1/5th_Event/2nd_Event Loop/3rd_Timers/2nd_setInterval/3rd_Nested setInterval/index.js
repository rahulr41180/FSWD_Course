
// Nested setInterval :

/* 
A nested setInterval() refers to using one setInterval() call inside another. This technique can be used to create more complex timing patterns.

In a nested setInterval(), you can start another setInterval() within the callback function of an existing setInterval().
*/

// Note :

/* 

Nested setInterval() can be a powerful tool for creating complex timing patterns, 
but it comes with challenges in terms of code complexity and performance. 
Understanding how to properly manage and clear intervals is crucial for avoiding memory leaks and ensuring smooth execution of timed actions. 
For more sophisticated timing needs, consider alternatives like chained setTimeout() or using 
Promises with async/await for more readable and maintainable code.
