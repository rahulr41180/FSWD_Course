Libuv: Node.js is designed to be asynchronous and event-driven, 
allowing it to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently. 
Libuv is a library that provides event loop, asynchronous I/O, 
and other core functionalities for Node.js. 
It abstracts away the differences in how various operating systems handle tasks like file I/O, 
networking, and concurrency.
*/

/*
Libuv is a key component of the Node.js runtime that provides the event loop and asynchronous 

I/O capabilities, enabling Node.js to handle high concurrency and I/O-intensive operations efficiently. 
Here's a deeper dive into Libuv:
*/

/*
In Node.js, you don't typically need to directly import Libuv or interact with it directly in your code. 
Instead, Libuv is integrated into the Node.js runtime and provides the underlying infrastructure 
that enables asynchronous I/O, event-driven architecture, threading, and other features.

When you write Node.js applications, you interact with the Node.js APIs and modules, 
which internally utilize Libuv for handling asynchronous tasks, networking operations, 
file system operations, and other tasks.

const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});

/*
In this example, the http module provided by Node.js internally uses Libuv to create an HTTP server, 
handle incoming requests asynchronously, and respond to those requests. 
However, as a developer, you don't need to directly import or interact with Libuv in your code.
