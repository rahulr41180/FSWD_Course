1. Tell me about your self?
2. Tell me about your current project?
    uses for user:
    domain: analytical
    tech stack: React.js, RestFul APIs, GraphQL APIs, Apollo Server, Apollo Client, MongoDB, Node.JS, Express.JS
    Architecture: Monolithic Architecture, Before RestFul APIs, GraphQL APIs
3. What are your roles and responsibilities in your current project?
    As a full stack developer my role is to handle the frontend and backend both
    First My manager creating a ticket on JIRA
    I am taking the request from the JIRA in the excel format
    Before going to start task.

    Usaually first I am creating the document 
    what is the requirement
    what will be my approach to implement and solve the requirement
    After implement, I am doing my unit testing by visiting on routes and funtionality
    After unit testing I am pusing my code into my repository branch and 
    after pushing the code my code will be pulling by tester into their branch and 
    testing team is checking all the APIs by using the Jest library.
    after that successfully testing the code will merge into main branch and than 
    my lead deploye that code into AWS we are using EC2 instance to deploye.
    Whenever we need that project to showace in front of our new client at that time we resume the service of our AWS.
    Usaually we have puted the service of AWS on stop mode otherwise it will charge of us.

    Note: One additional feature. I have suggested to my team to automatically upload the JIRA excel file 
    into database. They have noted my suggested but they are not going to implement right by they will definately.
4.  Why I have mentioned the Microsoft Azure, I am learning the Microsoft Azure and I want apportunity on this.
5. What is the technical design of your project.
    We have designed the current project with Even-Driven architecture and by following the Monolithic Architecture and 
    For APIs at start we were using the RestFul APIs architecture but currently we are using GraphQL APIs architecture
    for authentication and authorization we have used stateLess architecture by using jsonwebtoken.
6. Rate yourself in technical skill - 1 to 10?
    always say 8.
7.  Suppose it is the delivery time. and therefore you have to work on weekends.
    If need I will be there in the project at any time to achieve our delivery promise and to make positive sign.
    I would like to add something that In my current company I had supported them on weekends as well by working as a full day in the office.
    Because I am always open to take an apportunity.
8.  At last moment of project delivery, the requirement is changed.
    There could be situtation that.
    We have to implement the new requirement within the given time or within a new given time
    Comman things is that we will not going to remove the current implement in both cases there could be the situtation that we have to
    kept current implement as well.
    If we have to implement that in the previous time in that case, We have to choose our approach agile and we have to devide our work
    in a team if only one developer was working on that requirement now we can take support of another developer to acheive the goal
    if another developer is not free in that I have to extra to acheive goal.
    If we have to implement that in the new time in that, We have to choose our approach again agile and we can delivery our
    new requirement within given time.
9. Somebody resigned from the team and there is extra workload on you.
    I have to make my self always prepare for myself means If my current work delivery is 2 days and some situation came in that case
    I have to speedup and perallel I have to make a plane to manage extra work as well with current work.
10. You are asked to learn a new technology for a new project.
    Yes, I am always open to learn new technology.
    I would also like to say that I have visit the profile of company and found that in the 
    frontend company project are building with React.js and Next.js I have started learning from basics to make our application as SSR.
    Backend company project are building with Python and I have planned to learn Python.
11. You are introduced in a project with tight deadline.
    I had a one situtation in my current organization that was 
    Suddenly, Request came to change the layout of homepage for their festival
    and deadline was very tight why suddenly as I told you that we were not getting work directly from client instead we are getting
    work from our austerlia branch they gave us suddenly work and that we have to implement for that situtation
    we have handled by delivered the work into team because most of the time I handled the homepage that's why we abled to 
    acheive goal also ew have worked on weekends as well in my current company

Absolutely! Here are suggested answers to the additional questions, tailored to your experience as a Full Stack
Developer:

---

### 1. **How do you manage competing priorities in a project?**
**Answer:**
When managing competing priorities, I rely on effective communication, time management, and prioritization. I start by
understanding the critical requirements and deadlines from the project stakeholders. Then, I break down tasks into
smaller, manageable pieces and assess their impact on the overall project. I typically use tools like JIRA to keep track
of tasks and deadlines. If multiple priorities overlap, I focus on high-impact tasks first, ensuring that I deliver
value incrementally. I also communicate regularly with the team to ensure we are aligned and to adjust priorities if
necessary, especially if any roadblocks arise.

---

### 2. **How do you approach troubleshooting and debugging in a project?**
**Answer:**
I approach troubleshooting and debugging systematically to ensure that I identify the root cause of issues efficiently.
I begin by replicating the issue in a controlled environment to understand the symptoms. Then, I use browser developer
tools, logging (e.g., `console.log` in the frontend, or `winston`/`debug` in the backend), and other debugging tools to
track down errors. I also review the code flow, especially around the components or functions where the issue is
occurring. If the issue is complex, I break it down into smaller parts and test each part independently. When working in
teams, I collaborate with colleagues to leverage their insights and perspectives. Once the problem is resolved, I write
tests (unit or integration) to ensure that it doesn't recur.

---

### 3. **How do you ensure the code quality and maintainability in your projects?**
**Answer:**
To ensure code quality and maintainability, I follow best practices like writing clean, modular, and well-documented
code. I use naming conventions that make the codebase easier to understand and maintain. I also write unit tests and
integration tests to ensure functionality is correct and remains stable over time. I regularly perform code reviews with
the team, which helps catch issues early and ensures consistency across the codebase. For both frontend and backend, I
adhere to SOLID principles and design patterns to keep the codebase scalable and extensible. Additionally, I utilize
linters (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript) and formatters to enforce consistent coding styles.

---

### 4. **Tell me about a difficult technical challenge you faced and how you overcame it.**
**Answer:**
One of the more difficult challenges I faced was during the **Analytical Dashboard** project when we had to integrate
data from multiple sources, including external APIs and internal databases. The challenge was that the data was in
different formats and had varying levels of complexity, which made it difficult to efficiently aggregate and display on
the dashboard.

To solve this, I worked on designing a flexible GraphQL schema using **Apollo Server** to standardize the way data was
fetched, regardless of the source. I also implemented caching and pagination to ensure that data retrieval was optimized

for performance. Additionally, I collaborated closely with the backend team to ensure data consistency and to address
any API limitations. The result was a more responsive and scalable system that could handle large datasets without
compromising performance.

---

### 5. **How do you handle conflict or disagreements within the team?**
**Answer:**
I believe that open and respectful communication is key to resolving conflicts in a team. If a disagreement arises, I
first listen carefully to the concerns of all parties involved to understand the root cause of the issue. I then work
collaboratively to find a solution that aligns with the team's goals. I try to stay neutral and facilitate productive
discussions, focusing on facts and data to support decisions rather than emotions or personal opinions. If necessary, I
would involve the project manager or lead to mediate the discussion and help come to a consensus. The ultimate goal is
to find a solution that moves the project forward and keeps the team functioning efficiently.

### 6. **Can you explain how you approach writing unit tests or end-to-end tests?**
**Answer:**
When writing **unit tests**, I focus on testing individual functions or components in isolation to ensure that each
piece of the application behaves as expected. I use tools like **Jest** or **Mocha** for JavaScript testing, along with
**React Testing Library** for testing React components. My approach is to write tests that cover edge cases and validate
that the output matches the expected results given a variety of inputs.

For **end-to-end (E2E) testing**, I use tools like **Cypress** or **Selenium** to simulate user interactions and ensure
that the entire application flow works as intended. I typically write E2E tests for critical user journeys, such as
logging in, adding items to a shopping cart, or submitting a form. In both cases, I ensure that tests are maintainable,
easy to read, and cover the most important aspects of the application.

### 7. **How do you keep up-to-date with new technologies and trends in web development?**
**Answer:**
I believe in continuous learning, so I make it a priority to stay updated with new technologies and trends in web
development. I regularly follow blogs, newsletters, and forums like **Dev.to**, **Medium**, and **Stack Overflow** to
learn about the latest tools, frameworks, and best practices. I also watch tech talks and conferences (e.g.,
**ReactConf**, **JSConf**) to keep myself informed about emerging trends. I engage with the developer community on
GitHub, where I contribute to open-source projects, and on platforms like **Twitter** and **Reddit**, where developers
often discuss new technologies and share insights. I also try to experiment with new technologies by building side
projects or taking online courses to get hands-on experience.

---

### 8. **What is your experience with Agile methodologies and working in sprints?**
**Answer:**
I have experience working in an **Agile** environment, where we follow **Scrum** methodology with **2-week sprints**. In
each sprint, we break down the tasks into smaller, manageable user stories, and prioritize them based on business value.
We have daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, blockers, and what we plan to work on for the day. At the end of
each sprint, we conduct a sprint review to demonstrate the work completed and a sprint retrospective to discuss what
went well and what could be improved.

Working in Agile has taught me the value of iterative development, quick feedback loops, and collaboration across teams.
It also helps in adapting to changes in project requirements quickly, ensuring we always deliver working software that
meets user needs.

---

### 9. **How do you handle feedback or criticism on your work?**
**Answer:**
I view feedback and criticism as opportunities for growth. When I receive feedback, I first listen carefully to
understand the points being raised. I then reflect on the feedback and assess how I can improve my work. If I disagree
with some aspects of the feedback, I seek clarification in a constructive manner, asking for specific examples or
suggestions for improvement. I believe that feedback is a crucial part of the development process and helps ensure that
the end product is of the highest quality. I actively seek feedback from peers, code reviewers, and mentors to
continuously improve my skills.

---

### 10. **Tell me about a time you had to work with a difficult client or stakeholder and how you managed the
relationship.**
**Answer:**
In one of my previous projects, I worked with a client who had frequent changes in requirements and unclear
expectations, which caused some tension within the team. To manage the relationship, I proactively scheduled regular
meetings with the client to better understand their needs and expectations. I made sure to document the requirements and
scope in detail, ensuring that both the client and the team were on the same page. When changes arose, I communicated
the impact on timelines and resources, helping the client make informed decisions. By setting clear expectations and
keeping open lines of communication, I was able to build trust and ensure that the project was delivered successfully,
even with the changing requirements.
