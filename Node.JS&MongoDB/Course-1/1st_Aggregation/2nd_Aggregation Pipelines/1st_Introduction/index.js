
// Aggregation Reference :

/* 
An aggregation pipeline consists of one or more stages that process documents:

Each stage performs an operation on the input documents. 
For example, a stage can filter documents, group documents, and calculate values.

The documents that are output from a stage are passed to the next stage.

An aggregation pipeline can return results for groups of documents. For example, return the total, average, maximum, and minimum values.

You can update documents with an aggregation pipeline.
