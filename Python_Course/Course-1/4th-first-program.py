# print(Hello World);
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma?
# print(); In the Python language if we need to run print(); function then we need to give them a
# proper object to print somethings.
# So Hello World is not a proper object.
# But for printing the Hello World we need to these text in double couts for making it's a string.
# Like : "Hello World";
print("Hello World");

# Hello World : This is wrong, This will give us error called SyntaxError
# "Hello World" : This is right, This will give us result and This is called string
# Anything Inside the double coutes that called string.

# -------------------------------------------

print(7);
# Here we are printing 7 without double coutes.
# Because 7 is number and for printing the number we don't need use double coutes.
