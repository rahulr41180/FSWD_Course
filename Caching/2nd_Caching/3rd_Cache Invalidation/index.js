
// Cache Invalidation :

/* 
Cache invalidation ensures that stale data is removed or updated in the cache.
Strategies include:
Time-to-Live (TTL): Data is removed after a specified period.
Manual Invalidation: Data is explicitly removed or updated by the application when changes occur.
Write-Through/Write-Behind: Ensures the cache is updated or invalidated in sync with the primary data source.
