
// Let's consider a web application that displays user profiles :

/* 
Without Caching:

Every time a user requests a profile, the application queries the database to fetch the profile data.
This can result in high latency and increased load on the database, especially with many concurrent users.
With Caching:

The first time a user requests a profile, the application queries the database and stores the profile data in a cache (e.g., Redis).
Subsequent requests for the same profile are served from the cache, reducing database queries and improving response times.
