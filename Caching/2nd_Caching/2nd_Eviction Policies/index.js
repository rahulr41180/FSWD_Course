/* 
Caches have limited storage capacity, so eviction policies determine which data should be removed when the cache is full.
Common eviction policies include:
LRU (Least Recently Used): Removes the least recently accessed data.
FIFO (First In, First Out): Removes the oldest data.
LFU (Least Frequently Used): Removes the least frequently accessed data.
