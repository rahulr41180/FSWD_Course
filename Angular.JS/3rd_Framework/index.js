
// Framework :

/* 
A framework can have pre-defined classes and functions that can be re-used to add several functionalities, which otherwise we would have to write
from scratch by our own.

Means we have pre-defined classes to make a HTTP Request to server.

A framework is a collection of pre-defined classes and methods which provides APIs for performing different operations when used in an application.
