        You can use <abbr>CSS</abbr> (Cascading Style Sheets) to style your <abbr>HTML</abbr> (HyperText Markup
        Language).
        Using style sheets, you can keep your <abbr>CSS</abbr> presentation layer and <abbr>HTML</abbr> content layer
        separate. This is called "separation of concerns."

<!-- When including an abbreviation or acronym, provide a full expansion of the term in plain text on first use, 
along with the <abbr> to mark up the abbreviation. This informs the user what the abbreviation or acronym means.

<!-- 
Attributes :

This element only supports the global attributes. The title attribute has a specific semantic meaning when used with the <abbr> element; 
it must contain a full human-readable description or expansion of the abbreviation. 
This text is often presented by browsers as a tooltip when the mouse cursor is hovered over the element.

Each <abbr> element you use is independent of all others; 
providing a title for one does not automatically attach the same expansion text to others with the same content text.

<!-- 
Default styling :

The purpose of this element is purely for the convenience of the author and all browsers display it inline (display: inline) by default, 
though its default styling varies from one browser to another:

Some browsers add a dotted underline to the content of the element. 
Others add a dotted underline while converting the contents to small caps. 
Others may not style it differently than a <span> element. To control this styling, use text-decoration and font-variant.
