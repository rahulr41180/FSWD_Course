/* 

In the Redux generaly we do :
First Send the dispatch() this is called view
Second throught dispatch() action will send is called action
Third State will update by reducer.

But React does not understand the state of Redux and to resolve this issue React-Redux will come in Picture.
We will use React-Redux library to resolve this.
React-Redux will make the state to global state for the application.


React-Redux also has provider method concept and useSelector() method concept.
