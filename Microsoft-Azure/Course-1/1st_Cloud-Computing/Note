
------------------------------ Before Problem of Cloud Computing --------------------------------

1. Scalability : Increase hardware as user demand increase staff to maintain the servers.
2. High Cost : High upfront expenses and capital expenditure. High maintenance costs.
3. Server : Servers need to be managed and monitored continuously.
4. Slow Data Recovery : Takes more time to recover the data. Require high bugets and resources.

-------------------------------- After No above problem of cloud computing ----------------------

1. Scalability : Can easily scale up and down to meet demand.
2. Cost : Users pay only for the resources they use.

3. Server : All the resources and servers are maintained by vendors.
4. Data Recovery : Fatest data recovery as cloud creates backup.
