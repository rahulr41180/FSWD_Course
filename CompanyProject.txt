ReactElement:
ReactElement is a type definition, which will help TypeScript understand the types of elements 
we are dealing with (mainly JSX elements like <div>, <h5>, etc.).

import * as Pages from './pages/index';

import: This is the ES6 JavaScript module syntax for importing functionality from another file or module into the current file.
* as Pages: The * symbol here means "import everything" from the module. 
The as Pages part is renaming the entire collection of imported exports as Pages. 

In other words, all exports from the ./pages/index.js file (or ./pages/index.ts if you're using TypeScript) 
will be available under the Pages namespace.
