/* 
The TS compilers compiles the new features of TS to JS using some work arounds in JS

Means :
If we are using some new features of TS which is not present in JS then how the new feature work because we know at end the end TS code compiled into 
JS code then we only able to use TS code.

But what about new features.
New features also compiled into JS code and that TS code handled with complex logic of JS code.

So new features and existing features are compiled into JS code and handled with complex logic with existing features of JS code.

New features code easy to write in TS code.
Same new features achieve from JS code would be complex because we have to use JS existing features of code.

/* 
TS code is strongly typed
Because a type should defined to a variable explicitly.
Means TS code assigned type for variable at compiled time.
*/

/* 
JS code is dynamically typed language
Means run time JS code assigned type for variable not at compiled time.
