Eventually first we need to convert typeScript code into javaScript code with the help of tsc which is a compiler for typescript to convert
typeScript code into javaScript code because browser can only understand javaScript not typeScript that's why first we have to convert typeScript
code into javaScript code other wise typeScript won't run.

tsc .\fileName.ts -w :
If we are doing change in code in .ts file then we need to again and again compile the .ts file into .js file.
So to automate this thing we have to use watcher like : tsc .\fileName.ts -w
