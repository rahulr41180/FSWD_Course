// Note : Eventually first we need to convert typeScript code into javaScript code with the help of tsc which is a compiler for typescript to convert
// typeScript code into javaScript code because browser can only understand javaScript not typeScript that's why first we have to convert typeScript
// code into javaScript code other wise typeScript won't run.
// Example :
var a = "Hello World";
console.log("a :", a);
